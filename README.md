Python programs for the Virtual Ligand-Assisted Optimization (VLAO)

The VL_main.py (in the VL directory) is a program to calculate the penarty functions for the electronic and steric aproximation.
The main.py (in optimizer directory) is a program to perform optimization of VL parameters by the conjugate gradient method.
Each portion has a readme file with further information.

The codes have been slightly modified for publication from the version used in the paper (https://doi.org/XXXXXXXXXX), but it has been confirmed that essentially the same results are obtained.

Minor modifications may be required for different computational systems.
